## About this assignment
This assignment was intended to test my ability to create a slide deck using R Markdown.   

## Research Topic
This topic seeks to model the relationship between urban unrest and seasonal change in five nations in South and Southeast Asia: India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. 

## The Data
I employ 190 observations of urban unrest around the world between 1960 and 2014 as collected in the Peace Research Institute Oslo's Urban Social Disorder v.3 dataset.

## My Approach
I filtered data to include only instances of unrest for Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. I further refined data to exclude N/As and ambiguously coded values. I used the xaringan and moon_reader packages to format the presentation.
